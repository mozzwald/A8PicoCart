# PCB

The addition of a schottky diode allows the Pi Pico to be connected to USB while still connected to the Atari. The Pi Pico "Lite" boards already have a schottky diode to prevent back powering the USB port and this additional diode prevents the USB port from back powering the Atari. I have rotated the Pi Pico so the USB-C port and Reset button are at the top for easy access. This PCB was designed with [Diptrace 3.3.1.3](https://diptrace.com).

# 3D

The case is designed to be printed with an independent dual-extruder 3D printer (IDEX) in two colors. The logo background is a different color than the rest of the case to make it stand out. A button was added to the back which activates the *BOOTSEL* button for easy firmware upgrades.
